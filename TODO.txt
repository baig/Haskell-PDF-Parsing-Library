This is not ready for anything like prime time.

Things to do before it's ready for Hackage:
- Support binary data (Trevor mentioned attoParsec)
- Comment / Haddock the main functions
- Add some Hunit or QuickCheck testing
- Add some utility functions to make the watermarking implementation cleaner (font selection, dictionary manipulation, etc)
- I'm sure I've done silly stuff wrt. not using Prelude functions, or even re-writing my own functions multiple times
- Stuff I don't even know I don't know
